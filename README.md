Sentiment Classification with ML and BERT
This project explores sentiment classification using both traditional machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with BERT. 
The dataset consists of social media text labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The repository demonstrates a comparison of methodologies, showcasing their performance and practical applications in sentiment analysis.

Key Features:
Implementation of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for sentiment classification
Fine-tuning BERT for advanced sentiment analysis
Data preprocessing pipeline, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal
Comprehensive performance evaluation and error analysis
